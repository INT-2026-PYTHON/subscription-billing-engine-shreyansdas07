"""
Repositories — the ONLY place SQL lives.

Each repository wraps the Database connection and exposes methods that
take/return domain dataclasses (defined in billing_engine/models/).

⚠️ YOU IMPLEMENT every method body marked TODO.
   The signatures, docstrings, and the LedgerRepository's append-only
   guarantee are already in place — do not change them.

Conventions:
  - Always use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders) — NEVER f-string SQL.
  - Money values are persisted as TEXT using `money.to_storage()`.
  - Dates are persisted as ISO strings (`date.isoformat()`).
